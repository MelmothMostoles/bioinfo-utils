# Documentation

This is the place for documentation relating to general best practice, lists of machines and installed software, etc.

## A note on scripts
The scripts themselves can be found in [https://github.com/RBGKew/bioinfo-utils/utils](../utils). Scripts should, however have a corresponding documentation file with the same name but an '.md' extension, in the [https://github.com/RBGKew/bioinfo-utils/docs/utils](utils) folder of this directory.
