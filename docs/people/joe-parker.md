## About me.
I am an Early-Career Research Fellow in Phylogenomics at Kew. I work on methods and analyses for real-time phylogenomics. This involves two main projects:

1. Evaluating techniques for field-based sequencing and sequence analysis using MinION sequencing.
2. As part of the [Plant and Fungal Trees of Life](http://science.kew.org/strategic-output/plant-and-fungal-trees-life) project, designing infrastructure and analyses for kingdom-scale phylogenomics of genomic sequence data.

Prior to my fellowship at Kew I've been a DPhil student studying evolutionary virology with Prof. Oli Pybus at Oxford, a vaccine designer at the Weatherall IMM (MRC), and a mammalian phylogenomics postdoc at QMUL. My papers on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=WC7nAYAAAAJ)
