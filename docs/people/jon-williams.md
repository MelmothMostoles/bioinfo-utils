## About me.

I am a summer intern at RBG Kew, working on a bioinformatic approach to taxonomy. I have just completed a Master's in Systems Biology, having completed my Bachelor's in Mathematics. This coming October I will be returning to study to undertake a PhD working on image analysis for the use of low-cost airborne sensing.
