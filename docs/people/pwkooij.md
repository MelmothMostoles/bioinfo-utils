## About me
I am an Early Career Research Fellow at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, at the section for Comparative Fungal Biology. My main research focusses on the evolution and maintenance of the fungus-growing ant mutualism, but share interest in similar other fungus-growing insect mutualisms.

Current projects:

1. Trying to find the origin of the fungus-growing ant mutualism, by comparing fungal barcodes of ant symbionts with free-living relatives selected from the specimen rich fungarium at RBG, Kew.
2. Investigating what causes asexuality in the fungal symbiont; the role of polyploidy in asexuality; the role of mycoviruses that can cause castrating effects.
3. As part of the [Plant and Fungal Trees of Life](http://science.kew.org/strategic-output/plant-and-fungal-trees-life) project, I'm involved in constructing a phylogenomic tree of fungi using full genome sequences, and with a personal interest in the family Agaricaceae

Prior to my fellowship at Kew I've been a PhD student with Prof. Jacobus (Koos) Boomsma at the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, followed by a brief PostDoc in the same group. My papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TiMyVhUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pepijn_Kooij).
