## About me
I am an Early Career Research Fellow at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. My work is directed towards understanding the effects of chromosomal variation within plants. I am studying a diploid plant, sea beet (*Beta vulgaris* subspecies *maritima*), using a combination of bioinformatics, genotyping and molecular cytogenetic methods. 

Areas of research that I'm particularly interested in are:
 1. Variation in chromosome structure such as inversions, deletions and translocations.
 2. The regulation of chromosome pairing and recombination at meiosis.
 3. The evolution of repetitive DNA (e.g. tandem repeats and transposable elements).
