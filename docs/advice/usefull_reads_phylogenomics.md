# **Some papers that some of us found useful**

## **Alignment**

[Paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty448/5026659) looking at a method to remove non-homologous parts from alignments (working mainly on amino-acid sequences and protein-coding nucleotide sequences).  

## **tree concordance**

[Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/115774) looking for outlier genes.  

[Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/22/115774) using phyparts to map gene tree concordance on the supermatrix tree.  
This paper also briefly discusses what cutoff value for support in the input trees to use: they use SH-like support <80 as a cutoff.
