## **Understanding target capture sequencing data**

Understanding how the data have been generated is necessary to choose the right analysis tools, and to properly interpret the results.  
Here we only talk about data obtained from the Illumina sequencing of target DNA fragments captured using RNA baits. 

We first have to design baits to capture the target DNA (Figure 1):

1. we choose some genes that we want to study. These genes are the “target” genes.
2. we design RNA sequences (usually 120 bp long) that align to the target genes.  
These sequences are called “baits”, because they will allow to capture the target genes.  
The baits can be designed to overlap each-other, we then talk about “bait tiling”. 
3. we synthesize the baits with biotinylated nucleotides

People usually rely on a company to design and to synthesize the baits.
