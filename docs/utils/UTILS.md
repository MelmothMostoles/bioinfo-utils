# Utils

This is the place to put utility scripts - they can be submitted as a single script in this directory if they are a single file (otherwise a subdirectory with the same name as the script).

Please make sure that **all scripts are well-documented** and that where appropriate **attributed correctly** (e.g. if you have forked or developed code from elsewhere on the web, make sure the source attribution / license are observed)!

General documentation is in the docs folder.

##Correct documentation

At a minimum **all** scripts here should have the following:

* A sensible, informative name
* Basic usage information in the script header itself:
 * What the script does
 * Any arguments that are expected
* A boilerplate usage document in Markdown format with the same name, e.g `extract_fasta.py` with a corresponding `extract_fasta.md`
